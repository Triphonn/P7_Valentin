# Groupomania Social Network- 2022

Hello, and welcome to the Groupomania repository.

This project is a studying/training project, the goal was to make a company social network using back-end and front-end skills.
We needed to use a framework to get in this huge world of diversity. I chose VueJS which was the easiest and understandable for me.

## Installation

Here, I will explain how to intall my project.

First, you will need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or any text editor.

Then, you can clone the repo with :

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Triphonn/P7_Valentin

cd P7_Valentin

```

Now, you have to install the dependencies of each part.

For the front, you will use :

```bash
cd front

npm install
```

For the back, it is a bit more annoying, I'll let you check the README.md in the back folder, this will guide you to install the Back-End.

## Issues

If you have some issues with the installation, try this :

Open a Powershell in Admin mode and paste this command :

```bash
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
```

Now you can close the Powershell and it should work.

## Finished

You have now installed all the packages !
